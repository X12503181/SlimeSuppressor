# SlimeSuppressor

A plugin that suppresses/disables slime spawning in slime chunks. Potentially very useful in superflat worlds.

Note: other slime spawns (those spawning in swamps or splitting from previously killed ones) will not be affected.

## Requirement

This plugin requires **1.16.4/1.16.5 Spigot** servers (forks such as Paper are fine). 

## Configuration

***WIP***. For plugin configuration, see [**config.yml**](src/main/resources/config.yml).
