# Note: "slime-spawning-enabled" will override "slime-spawn-chance".
# If the former is set to false then slimes will not spawn at all no matter how the latter is set.

# "slime-spawn-chance" should be a number between 0 and 1 (don't use percentages).

# These settings will never affect slimes spawning in swamps or splitting from previously killed ones.
